# Movie Review Analysis

This project contains an in-depth analysis of a movie review collection dataset from rottentomatoes.com
It implements a Multi-nomial Naive Bayes classifier to determine if a movie is rated "rotten" or "fresh" given its review text.


Part 1	- EDA

		- Basic features of the dataset

		- Number of reviews per reviewer
 
		- Top 30 critics who have most reviews

		- Trends in ratings over time


Part 2	- Implement Naive Bayes classifier

		- Using CountVectorizer

		- Cleaning messy text

		- Split dependant and independant variables

		- Split data set into train and test

		- Use Multi-Nomial Naive Bayes to classify "rotten" and "fresh" reviews


Part 3	- Model Evaluation

		- Estimate Likelihood

		- Re-sampling (k-Fold Cross Validation) for finding best values of hyper-parameters

		- Bar plot of log Probabilities for top 10 "Rotten" & top 10 "Fresh" words
		
		- Error Analysis to find top 5 misclassified reviews to review the "Naive" assumption


Part 4	- Principal Component Analysis (Seperate section on PCA and its visualization, on Boston housing dataset)
